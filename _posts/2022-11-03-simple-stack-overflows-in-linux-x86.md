  Hello everyone, in this resume i'm going to explain some basic things
about stack based buffer overflows. First, we need to to understand how 
it works in theory.

  When a computer program is executed, it is loaded into the system's
memory. Inside the computer's memory we have three sections. 
 
  1 - code
  2 - stack
  3 - heap


  The code section is where the program instructions are loaded. 
  The stack section is where the program's local variables are loaded.
  The heap is also a region of memory used for dynamic allocation.
